Spring boot web security
	
Example 1:
	we are going to create a spring boot application 
	with a rest controller
	/
		hello world

	while creating a spring boot application using spring initializer
		we add dependencies
			Spring Web
			Spring security	

	once this spring security is added, SecurityAutoConfiguration will be enabled

@SpringBootApplication(exclude = SecurityAutoConfiguration.class)

Example 2:
	we are going to configure the security configuration
	
	lets create a configuration class

	user object is always required in a login validation

	spring boot security 		(spring security core)
		User
		UserDetails
		UserDetailsService


	1) configuration
		a class with annotation @EnableWebSecurity
		that extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter
		and over the configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) method 
		
	2) service
