Lets deploy our spring boot application in AWS


in personal account
	aws will ask MFA		Multi Factor Authentication

	you are familiar with MFA	how?		
	in cognizant email, you enter username, password, MFA


but in cognizant account, we just need to enter 
	12 digit
	username
	password

we deploy our spring boot app in aws	only in "Elastic Beanstalk"

Lets create a spring boot application now

Error:
 No compiler is provided in this environment. Perhaps you are running on a JRE rather than a JDK?
Fix:
	eclipse -> Window -> Preferences -> Java -JRE -> choose JDK instead of JRE


	Maven build 		clean install

	in projects target folder, we could see a jar file created now.

This jar file will be deployed in AWS

	in aws,
		go to elastic beanstalk.
		create an application

		choose platform as "Java" while creating environment


IMPORTANT:
	go to application.properties
	server.port=5000

5000 should be the preferred port for apache tomcat in AWS


in aws portal
	go to RDS
		Relational Database Service
