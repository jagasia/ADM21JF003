CID
	Continuous Integration

CD
	Continuous Delivery			(Deployment)



yesterday, we deployed a springboot app in aws elastic beanstalk.
	today, we continue to work on this project in spring tool suite.
	i am adding new entities, new repo, new controller
	the project is growing.

	In agile model, we do project in iteration. 

	every time, how we are going to update the project in the elastic beanstalk?

	this is where CI has a role to play.
		Continuous Integration

	Imagine, if we give developers a liberty to push their projects into GitHub.
		just push your project in git. it will be updated in aws automatically.

	Source		project is pushed into git hub 
	Build		jar file is tested for errors. db connectivity is tested
	Deploy		depolyment in aws beanstalk


How? to do CI in aws?
	1) in aws, you have to navigate to
		Code Pipeline

		create a pipeline	
			and authorize our git account and repository
			map to a beanstalk application

		source			successful if git repo is accessible
		build			building  jar files
		deploy			the project (jar) is deployed in aws

Need for spring security
	it is very useful in REST api

		because, we cannot remember the identity of user across 2 method calls in rest api


in @Controller
	we can do session management
		in one of the methods, he provide user name and password. if login is success, then
		HttpSession session.setAttri...		add his user object in session.

		in other methods, we can use that session var






OAuth2
	Open Authentication			Single Sign on	SSO		

	i have a gmail account. 		i can use this to login to your application


if you try to access any url, first it will prompt you to login
	if you have gmail account, you can login

		gmail
		github
		facebook

i am logging into udemy.com using facebook account

how this is possible?
	in my spring boot application, i want to allow users to login using open authentication
		OAuth2


JWT
	suppose i directly access an url of your rest api, 
	a login page comes in front

	but if i access your url from post man?		how will a login page? no. but still i want to access your page, so i can provide JSON web token in the authorization



security auto configuration				this is the reason for authentication



Restful web services
	jax rs

f/w
	jersey
		the content negotiation is not automatic
		we have to specify

			consumes			json		xml		text
			produces			json		xml		text

			return new Employee();			///not sophisticated to understand that it should become json

			return new ResponseEntity
				status code, headers, data

	spring

allow us to create restful webservices


spring boot 
	Rest Controller
			new Employee();				


the content negotiation
	if you return a data
		String
		Employee
		

	preference
		text, json, xml (explicitly mention that it produces XML)
